# SyntheticCorrelationVAE - VAE vs PCA

## Overview

This project utilizes VAEs and probabilistic PCA to generate synthetic correlation matrices for 44 stock indices. The experiments are based on historical data sourced from Datastream (requires a paid subscription).

## Experiments

Explore stylized facts of correlation matrices and their properties, including pairwise correlations, Marchenko-Pastur eigenvalues, Perron-Frobenius property, hierarchical structure, and MST degrees distribution.

## Data

The data for 44 stock indices is sourced from `DATASTREAM_IT_EU_US_EMERGING.txt` (requires a paid Datastream subscription).
